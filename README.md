# 💫 PHILOSOPHY:
<br>Code is Craft<br>I view coding as both an intellectual and creative pursuit — I enjoy reading code deeply, recognizing patterns, and treating structure like a well-played game of Tetris.<br>Quality over Haste<br>I don’t commit to solutions unless they meet industry standards of quality, maintainability, and clarity — solving problems thoughtfully, not just quickly.<br>Eliminate, Simplify, Strengthen<br>I believe in continuously improving code by removing repetition through frameworks and architecture, which enhances long-term maintainability and keeps development engaging.<br>Ideas over Distractions<br>I value teams and discussions that revolve around ideas and solutions — prioritizing growth, curiosity, and principle in the way I work and collaborate.
